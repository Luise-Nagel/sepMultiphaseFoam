## sepMultiphaseFoam

<span style="color:red">**under construction**</span>


sepMultiphaseFoam is a gemetrical volume-of-fluid (VoF) OpenFOAM based multiphase solver.
Currently focusing on the improvement of surface tension on unstructured grids, we strive to improve by and by

* **surface tension**  (in cooperation with TU Darmstadt, Mathematical Modeling & Analysis, T. Maric)
* wetting effects
* phase change
* species transport

In **bold** the current status is marked.

The *branches* starting with `publications/` clearly all mark publications.
These contain next to the preprint also the
* data
* setups and
* evaluation scripts
and you find explanatory ReadMe files.

### Getting Started


### Installation
To install, you must first install OpenFOAM v2112 from www.openfoam.com.
Please follow the installation guide there to ensure a working OpenFOAM version.

Afterwards you can clone this repository by simply typing

`git clone https://github.com/boschresearch/sepMultiphaseFoam`

Afterwards you can compile it against your general OpenFOAM version.
